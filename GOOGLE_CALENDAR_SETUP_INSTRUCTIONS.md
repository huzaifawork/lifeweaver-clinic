---

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Complete Integration**

### **Step 1: Get Your Service Account Key**

Since the browser automation environment can't directly transfer files to you, you need to download the JSON key manually:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: 
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/details/112692055783990850972/keys?project=lwv-calendar-integration
   ```

2. **Create a New Key**:
   - Click "Add Key" → "Create new key"
   - Select "JSON" → Click "Create"
   - Save the file as `lwv-calendar-service-account-key.json` in your project root

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install googleapis
```

### **Step 3: Set Up Your Calendar**

1. **Create a Google Calendar** (or use an existing one) for your clinic
2. **Share the calendar** with your service account:
   - Go to your Google Calendar settings
   - Share with: `lwv-clinic-calendar-service@lwv-calendar-integration.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Give "Make changes and manage sharing" permissions
3. **Get the Calendar ID** from calendar settings (or use `'primary'` for main calendar)

### **Step 4: Test the Integration**

Use the provided `google-calendar-integration-complete.js` file:

```javascript
const LifeweaversCalendarIntegration = require('./google-calendar-integration-complete');

async function test() {
  const calendar = new LifeweaversCalendarIntegration(
    './lwv-calendar-service-account-key.json',
    'primary' // or your specific calendar ID
  );

  await calendar.initialize();
  await calendar.testConnection();
}

test();
```
