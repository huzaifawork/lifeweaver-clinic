Subjective

Jyo was seated out in a geriatric chair, NGT in situ.

Accompanied by husband, helper (Paula) and daughter (Gayatri). Jyo was slightly grumpy at start of session, mood seems improved as session progressed.

Reason For Referral

To improve communication abilities post stroke

Expectations For therapy And Clients Mindset

Reported difficulty in the following areas

For each reported difficulty score 1 - 10 ( 1=minor difficulty, 10= major difficulty)

Communication: reported difficulty 10

noted from Gayatri that Jyo struggles to communicate her needs and wants. Most of it is anticipated by caregiver (Paula) and family

Jyo was observed to be have spontaneous utterances at phrase level but they are not always relevant or sufficient to express her needs and wants.

Jyo would often demonstrate frustrations due to communication difficulties and often say hurtful things to her family.

Gayatri shares that family is hopeful for Jyo to make as much improvement to her communication abilities to reduce her frustrations where possible, however they are also understanding that a full recovery back to baseline communication abilities may not be possible

Method of Evaluation

Initial assessment

- Medical and social history

(3/3/25)  CT Brain:

Acute right MCA territory infarct with hypodense changes involving the right frontal operculum and insula. No haemorrhagic conversion or significant mass effect.

Occlusion of the right MCA distal M1 segment with moderate collateralization.

Major arteries in the neck are patent but tortuous.

Assessment  tools used

Case history provided by Gayatri (23/5/25 via phone call, 29/5/25 in session)

Eating and drinking

since discharge home, family feels that Jyo is eating better, able to finish ½ to ¾ of what she was able to eat premorbidly

Jyo was described to be a small eater, taking a sandwich for meals at times

Jyo was also noted to have left sided chewing difficulties before the stroke, nil orthodontic treatment sought or rendered

able to take whole tablets 1 by 1 with nil noted difficulties

no dentures

Communication

Jyo was an avid reader and was able to speak multiple languages

She was also very outgoing and enjoys going out to meet with friends.

Gayatri feels that Jyo is aware of her current abilities and it makes her frustrated. However when their friends visited recently, Jyo was able to ask about the friend's dog without hesitation and no difficulties recalling.

Previous ST and communication intervention

Gayatri shared that throughout Jyo’s stay at the hospital, she had minimal interactions with the ST

Jyo does not have any ST follow up for swallowing or communications either

Family noticed that Jyo was able to sing well, does not miss lyrics or skip the beats, so they had requested for music therapy (MT)

Jyo had about 4 sessions of MT at SGH

Dysphagia assessment:

oromotor assessment not done due to poor compliance at start of session when Jyo appeared guarded towards ST.

Trialled:

Level 7 soft, regular diet - x2 beignet with cream

Level 0 thin fluids (water) - x2 cup sips

fed by helper,  self drinking via cup

Oral phase:

good oral reception

adequate lip seal, nil anterior spillage

fair orolingual control

slow but adequate mastication, aligned with overall general slowness of eating and drinking

nil significant residue post-swallow

Pharyngeal phase

mild delayed

mild reduced hyolaryngeal excursion

clear voice

nil signs of aspiration noted across trials

Communication assessment

Attempted to use a communication screener, however Jyo was  becoming increasingly upset at the end of orientation questions. Communication was thus informally assessed with aim to ascertain suitable strategies instead.

Spontaneous speech:

Jyo was noted to have spontaneous utterances at worlds to phrases/short sentence level (e.g give me the toothbrush, toothbrush, plate, i am tired, can i go to sleep now?)

speech utterances were largely intelligible to 80-90% accuracy

noted to speak at keywords to however not always easily understood by family, leading to frequent communication breakdown

able to ask questions, relevant to the context most of the time (e.g “what do you mean?, “can i go to bed please?”)

fair ability to repeat at short utterance level, however this may be impacted by attention.

Orientation questions:

provided name only when shown written prompts of her name

provided her date of birth when shown “195_” in fill in the blanks prompts

did not respond regarding place even with written binary choices - started saying “what is the point”, raising her voice

Confrontational naming: 10/10

slow in response, but benefits from additional time given

benefitted from fill in the blank prompts verbal > written

noted perseverations (i.e repeating answer from previous picture while looking at the next stimuli)

initially very frustrated when asked to name pictures, would look away, but eventually encouraged when she was able to achieve success

semantic descriptors were also helpful (e.g it is a fruit, you sit on it)

errors were mostly semantic errors (e.g labrador > dog, mercedes > car, football > basketball)

Written word to picture matching: 0/2

poor engagement in task, likely further confounded by left sided inattention

reading mostly options on her right visual space, ignoring the ones of the left

frustrated ++, verbalising phrases e.g “what is the point”, “i can't”

Others:

frequent frustration outburst noted during communication breakdown

Jyo would also attempt to disengage at times by looking away at times, requiring redirection and frequent encouragemet

Activity trialled:

Tactus therapy app (Lite)

Naming and flashcards sub categories

Jyo demonstrated interest in tablet application more than pictures given in earlier trials

able to achieve 5/5 with prompts

benefits from repetition of trials to increase speed and confidence in responses (i.e respond faster with each set of repetition)

Jyo demonstrates good motivation and engagement in tasks with encouragement and frequent micro breaks

increased frequency of perseverations towards end of session

eventually fatigued and was able to say “I want to sleep now”.

nil frustration outburst during tasks when adequately paced and supported. Jyo even asked for the next stimuli

Diagnosis and recommendations

Functional swallows with nil signs of aspiration across trials.

Expressive more than receptive aphasia with cognitive overlay

Recommendations

For weekly speech therapy to work on establishing practice tasks with consistent strategies for family to support in conversation.

spoke to family on daily practice, 5 trials each time and repeat to increase frequency and familiarity with practice tasks and strategies

Gayatri informed that ST Mann is not available next week (2-9 June), but able to arrange for weekly sessions after

Gayatri noted and will liaise with Norm when she has sorted her schedule as well. Not for back to back sessions with other therapy sessions for now due to fatigability.

To monitor left inattention, consider OT as needed when family is ready.

ST Plan for next session:

spelling and letter manipulation: anagrams for names

CGT to helper to cue during activity and communication breakdown

oromotor assessment if Jyo is better able to engage

| This platform and line of questioning is a little confusing for me. My mother has had a stroke so I’m unsure of whether I’m filling this out from her perspective or mine… BUT:
We do require a speech therapist in a package form, I think. My mother was recently discharged and cleared to come home from OCH. She suffered a stroke on March 3rd. The contact information provided is my sister, she is the main person of contact here! |
